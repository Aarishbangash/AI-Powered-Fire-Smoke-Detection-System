# AI-Powered Fire & Smoke Detection System

# AI-Powered Fire & Smoke Detection System

## Overview

This project leverages the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 deep learning model to detect fire and smoke in images and videos. By combining powerful object detection with a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard and deployment on Hugging Face Spaces, the system provides a robust solution for early fire hazard detection.

The model was trained on a diverse dataset from [Roboflowâ€™s FireSmoke Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/catargiuconstantin/firesmokedataset) which includes over 46,000 images captured in various conditionsâ€”day and night, urban and rural settings. This diversity ensures that the system can be deployed in a wide range of environments.
